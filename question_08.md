
The <figure> tag and <img> tag have different purposes and usage within HTML:

01: <img> tag: The <img> tag is used to insert an image into an HTML document. It is a void element, meaning it does not have a closing tag. The <img> tag requires the src attribute, which specifies the URL or file path of the image to be displayed. Other attributes like alt, width, and height can also be used to provide alternative text, specify dimensions, or add additional information about the image.

Example: <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">

02: <figure> tag: The <figure> tag is used to encapsulate self-contained content, such as images, illustrations, diagrams, videos, code snippets, etc., along with their captions or descriptions. It provides a semantic structure for grouping together the content and its related information. The <figure> tag is often used in conjunction with the <figcaption> tag, which is placed inside the <figure> element to provide the caption or description for the content.

Example: <figure>
         <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
         <figcaption>Caption for the image</figcaption>
         </figure>

In the example above, the <figure> element contains the <img> element representing the image and the <figcaption> element providing the caption for that image.

In summary, while the <img> tag is used specifically for inserting images, the <figure> tag is used to group and provide additional context or description to self-contained content, including images. The <figure> tag helps to create a semantic structure and improve accessibility by associating captions or descriptions with the content they refer to.
