The HTML tag and attribute are different components in HTML:

01: HTML Tag: An HTML tag is a markup element that defines the structure and presentation of content within an HTML document. Tags are represented by opening and closing angle brackets (< and >). Tags can enclose other elements, text, or content and may have attributes to provide additional information about the element. Examples of HTML tags include <div>, <p>, <h1>, and <img>.

02: HTML Attribute: An HTML attribute provides additional information or modifies the behavior of an HTML element. Attributes are added within the opening tag of an element and are specified using the attribute name followed by an equal sign (=) and the attribute value enclosed in quotes. Attributes can be used to set properties like the source of an image, the width of an element, or the behavior of a link. Examples of HTML attributes include src, alt, class, href, style, and many more.

Example of some global attributes in HTML (these attributes can be used with most HTML elements):

01: class: Specifies one or more CSS classes to be applied to an element, allowing for styling or targeting with CSS or JavaScript.

02: id: Provides a unique identifier for an element, which can be used for styling or targeting with CSS or JavaScript.

03: style: Defines inline CSS styles for an element, allowing for the application of specific styles directly to the element.

04: title: Adds a tooltip or advisory information that is displayed when hovering over the element.

05: lang: Specifies the language of the content within the element, aiding in language-specific processing or accessibility.

06: tabindex: Sets the tab order of an element for keyboard navigation.

07: data-*: Allows the addition of custom data attributes to elements, providing a way to store custom data for JavaScript or CSS usage.

These are just a few examples of global attributes in HTML. There are many other attributes specific to different elements or their purposes. Attributes provide flexibility and additional functionality to HTML elements, enhancing their behavior and customization.
