Semantic tags in HTML are elements that provide meaning and structure to the content within a web page. They describe the purpose or role of the content, making it more understandable for both humans and search engines. Semantic tags go beyond purely presentational elements and help create a well-structured and accessible document.

Here are some commonly used semantic tags in HTML5:

01: <header>: Represents the introductory or navigational content at the top of a document or section.

02: <nav>: Defines a section of navigation links.

03: <main>: Represents the main content of the document. There should be only one <main> element per page.

04: <article>: Defines a self-contained composition within a document, such as a blog post, news article, or forum post.

05: <section>: Represents a thematic grouping of content within a document.

06: <aside>: Contains content that is tangentially related to the surrounding content, such as sidebars or pull quotes.

07: <footer>: Represents the footer of a document or section, typically containing author information, copyright notices, or links to related documents.

Semantic tags help in several ways:

01: Accessibility: Semantic tags improve accessibility by providing a clear structure to screen readers and other assistive technologies. They make it easier for users with disabilities to navigate and understand the content.

02: Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Search engines can better understand the content and context of a page when semantic tags are used. This can positively impact search rankings and improve visibility in search results.

03: Maintainability and Readability: Semantic tags make the HTML code more readable and maintainable for developers. By using tags that accurately describe the content, it becomes easier to understand the structure of the page, which can be beneficial during development and future updates.

04: Styling and Layout: Semantic tags provide a foundation for CSS styling and layout. They allow developers to target specific sections of a page more precisely, making it easier to apply consistent styles and responsive designs.

Overall, semantic tags help create well-organized, accessible, and SEO-friendly web pages. They enhance the structure and meaning of the content, improving both the user experience and development process.
