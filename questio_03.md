In HTML, the terms "tags" and "elements" are related but have distinct meanings:

01: HTML Tags: Tags are the building blocks of HTML markup. They are used to define the structure and presentation of elements within an HTML document. HTML tags are represented by angle brackets (< and >) and are typically written in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag. For example, <p> is an opening tag, and </p> is a closing tag. Tags can also have attributes that provide additional information about the element, such as <img src="image.jpg">, where src is an attribute specifying the image source.

02: HTML Elements: Elements consist of tags, their content, and any attributes that define them. An HTML element represents a specific component or part of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and form inputs. An element begins with an opening tag and ends with a closing tag, enclosing the content within. For example, <p>Text content</p> is an HTML element that represents a paragraph with the content "Text content" enclosed within it.

To summarize, HTML tags are the markup language's syntax used to define elements, while HTML elements refer to the combination of tags, content, and attributes that represent specific components or parts of a web page. Elements are created by enclosing content within opening and closing tags, forming a structured representation of the content on the page.
